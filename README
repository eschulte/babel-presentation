A Multi-Language Computing Environment for Literate Programming and Reproducible Research

This presentation introduces the use of Org-mode [1] as a platform for
Reproducible Research and Literate Programming.  It closely follows
the related JSS paper [2] in both content and form.  Examples are
included demonstrating the interactive use of code blocks from within
Org-mode documents.  The intended presentation engine is epresent [3],
however it should also be suitible for export to LaTeX Beamer format [4].
